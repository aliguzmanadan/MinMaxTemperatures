# MinMaxTemperatures
Machine learning project to predict the maximum temperature in a day, given its minimum temperature

In this repository, I develop a linear regression model (of polynomial type) to predict the maximum temperature in a day, given its minimum temperature. 

The data is taken from the "Weather Conditions in World War Two"dataset in kaggle. See https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smid80/weatherww2
